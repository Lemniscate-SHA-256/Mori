High-Level Design
The software will be a desktop application that allows architects and designers to create and manipulate biomimetic designs. The application will have the following components:

User Interface (UI):

Main window with a canvas for design visualization.
Toolbars and menus for various design tools and options.
Panels for properties, layers, and project management.
Core Functionality:

Project management (create, save, load projects).
Design tools (draw, edit, delete shapes and structures).
Biomimicry algorithms (generate designs based on natural patterns and processes).
Visualization tools (2D and 3D views, rendering).
Data Storage:

Support for different file formats (e.g., XML, JSON) for saving and loading projects.
Database for storing pre-defined biomimetic patterns and user projects.
External Libraries and APIs:

Use libraries for 3D rendering (e.g., OpenTK).
Integrate with machine learning libraries for advanced biomimicry algorithms (e.g., ML.NET).
