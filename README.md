#Mori

Mori is more than a software to draw, design, calculate and systematize biomimicry and bioarchitectural projects. It is beyond dream, it makes people think about the wonders of advanced, safe, revolutionary nature mechanisms and ways of dealing with them.

The goal of Mori is to reconnect technology with nature, man with wilderness, to let man breathe.

With Mori, let your design breathe and be concise.

To define architecture the way of nature, it is to draw on aesthetic practical engineering tools evolved billions of years ago to make innovative design, structures and bionify life.

"Now there is one outstandingly important fact about Spaceship Earth, and that is that no instruction manual came with it."
